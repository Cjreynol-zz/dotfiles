# Dotfiles

My personal collection of configuration files, specifically for use with the 
bash shell in the macOS Terminal application.

## Set up

Copy or symlink the files in this repository excluding this file, the .git 
directory, my\_brew.txt, and brew.sh, into your home directory.

Ensure that brew.sh is executable (`chmod +x brew.sh`) and install the 
my\_brew.txt list of programs with `./brew.sh`
