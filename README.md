# Dotfiles

My personal collection of configuration files.  

These are specifically for used with the bash shell in the macOS Terminal 
application, there may be issues using this in other environments.

## Set up

Copy or symlink the files in this repository excluding this file, the .git 
directory, my\_brew.txt, and brew.sh, into your home directory.

To install homebrew packages, ensure that brew.sh is executable 
(`chmod +x brew.sh`) and install the my\_brew.txt list of programs with 
`./brew.sh`
